# Running Autonomous Agents with LLM JSON Fix

## Problem Overview

The `phi-4-mini-reasoning` model outputs its reasoning process before providing JSON responses, causing parsing errors in the autonomous agent system.

## Solution Applied

The fix has been applied to `/services/core/src/services/llm_service.py` with:

1. **Enhanced JSON extraction** - Better regex patterns to find JSON in reasoning text
2. **Improved prompts** - Guides the model to output JSON after "Response:"
3. **Fallback mechanism** - Extracts structured data even when JSON parsing fails
4. **Better error handling** - Graceful degradation for reasoning models

## How to Run with the Fix

### Option 1: Using the Runner Script (Recommended)

```bash
cd mas-production-system
python3 examples/run_autonomous_fixed.py
```

This script will:
- Check if Docker services are running
- Optionally restart the core service to ensure the fix is loaded
- Run the autonomous agent inside Docker

### Option 2: Manual Docker Restart

```bash
cd mas-production-system

# Restart the core service
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml restart core

# Wait a moment for the service to be ready
sleep 10

# Run the autonomous agent
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec core python /app/examples/autonomous.py
```

### Option 3: Direct Testing

Test the LLM fix directly:

```bash
cd mas-production-system
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec core python /app/examples/test_llm_json_fix.py
```

## Verifying the Fix

To verify the fix is applied:

```bash
cd mas-production-system
python3 scripts/apply_llm_fix.py
```

This will check if the fix is present in the code.

## What the Fix Does

When the `phi-4-mini-reasoning` model returns reasoning text like:

```
Okay, let's see what I need to do here...
[reasoning process]
...
```

The fix will:

1. Try to extract JSON after "Response:", "JSON:", "Output:" markers
2. Look for JSON in code blocks (```json ... ```)
3. Search for JSON objects at the end of the text
4. If no valid JSON found, create a structured response based on the prompt type

## Monitoring

Check the logs for successful JSON parsing:

```bash
# View recent logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs --tail=50 core | grep -E "(JSON|parse|response)"

# Follow logs in real-time
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs -f core
```

## Troubleshooting

If you still see JSON parsing errors:

1. **Ensure the service has restarted** - The fix requires a service restart
2. **Check volume mounts** - The source code should be mounted at `/app/src`
3. **Verify the fix is in place** - Run `python3 scripts/apply_llm_fix.py`
4. **Check Docker logs** - Look for any startup errors

## Expected Behavior

With the fix applied, you should see:
- ✅ Agents successfully parsing responses from phi-4-mini-reasoning
- ✅ Structured fallback responses when JSON extraction fails
- ✅ Clear logging of response handling
- ✅ No more "Expecting value: line 1 column 1" errors
