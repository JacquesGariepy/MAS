# MAS Agent Creation Fix Summary

## Issue
All agent types (reactive, reflexive, hybrid) were failing with 500 errors when attempting to create them.

## Root Causes Found

### 1. Import Path Conflict
- **Problem**: There were duplicate agent factory files with conflicting imports
  - `/src/agents/agent_factory.py` was importing from wrong paths: `src.agents.types.reflexive_agent`
  - The actual agents were in `/src/core/agents/`
- **Fix**: Updated imports in `agent_factory.py` to use correct paths from `src.core.agents`

### 2. Missing Abstract Method Implementations
- **Problem**: `ReflexiveAgent` and `HybridAgent` classes were missing implementations for abstract methods from `BaseAgent`:
  - `act()` - Execute actions based on intentions
  - `deliberate()` - Form intentions based on beliefs and desires
  - `handle_message()` - Handle incoming messages
  - `handle_task()` - Handle assigned tasks
- **Fix**: Added all missing method implementations to both classes

## Files Modified

1. `/services/core/src/agents/agent_factory.py` - Fixed import paths
2. `/services/core/src/agents/__init__.py` - Fixed imports and added AgentRuntime
3. `/services/core/src/core/agents/reflexive_agent.py` - Added missing abstract methods
4. `/services/core/src/core/agents/hybrid_agent.py` - Added missing abstract methods

## Test Results

After fixes:
- ✅ Reactive agents: Creating successfully
- ✅ Reflexive agents: Creating successfully  
- ✅ Hybrid agents: Creating successfully

## Implementation Details

### ReflexiveAgent Methods Added:
- `deliberate()`: Returns intentions based on active rules
- `act()`: Executes actions based on rules and stimuli
- `handle_message()`: Adds messages to environment for rule processing
- `handle_task()`: Converts tasks to stimuli for rule-based response

### HybridAgent Methods Added:
- `deliberate()`: Switches between reflexive/cognitive based on complexity
- `act()`: Uses mode-appropriate decision making
- `handle_message()`: Assesses message complexity to determine mode
- `handle_task()`: Evaluates task priority for mode selection

## Verification
The fix has been verified by successfully creating agents of all three types via the API.
